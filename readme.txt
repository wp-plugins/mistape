Mistape allows readers to effortlessly notify site staff about found spelling errors.

== Description ==
Strive to keep your content flawless? Mistape will help!

Let your readers notify you about spelling mistakes they may encounter. Make them feel attentive and helpful, and show your care fixing reported errors.

On Ctrl+Enter event, plugin sends selected text along with paragraph and page URL it belongs to an email address selected in admin settings page. You can choose among administrators and editors, or specify another address.

The plugin is very lightweight. The "press Ctrl+Enter..." caption (or your own text) can be configured to be automatically appended to selected post types, or be inserted anywhere using a shortcode. Disabled features don't get loaded so performance impact is minimized to the lowest notch.

Besides text, caption also can be set as image defined by URL.

Mistape is full of hooks enabling you to modify its behavior the way you like.

== Installation ==
1. Look up "Mistape" and and install it from plugins section of your site's admin area. Alternatively, download zip from WordPress.org Plugin Directory and extract its contents to wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate and follow the settings link in the notice you will see at the top. Tick desired checkboxes, save, and that's it!

All settings are stored in a single database entry and get wiped on plugin uninstall, so you can be sure your WP installation won't be clogged if you decide you don't want Mistape anymore (and we're sure you won't :) ).
